Repo For Nft based games
# Project Overview:
- This project is made to bring, few brain-stimulating games to a set, beginning with chess.
- And my main motive to design this prototype is to upstream the personal growth of users who usually beloved to play brain-active games, users will experience enjoyment & fun, along with recognition from our side, facilitated by the use of NFTs. These NFTs play a vital role by providing tags at each level.

## How to contribute:
- Clone the repo **`git clone https://github.com/saidinesh49/Grow_Hard.git`**
- And then create a new-Branch on your local repo with the name of your game. (Please Don't make PR's directly on the main branch).
- Create a folder in the Grow_Hard **`(root directory)`** with the name of the game you want to add **`example_game`**
- Commit with a purposeful message, mentioning how it is useful: eg.., **`git commit -m "purpose_of_the_game"`**
