Repo For Nft based games
# Project Overview:
- This project is made to bring, few brain-stimulating games to a set, beginning with chess.
- And my main motive to design this prototype is to upstream the personal growth of users who usually beloved to play brain-active games, users will experience enjoyment & fun, along with recognition from our side, facilitated by the use of NFTs. These NFTs play a vital role by providing tags at each level.
