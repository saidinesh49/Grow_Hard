Actually, grow origin and grow hard are as same but grow origin is Oldest version (which just have the login and navigation to the home , and chess board for two player one device game play) and where as "Grow_Hard" contains the updated version that is have login ,signup  ,password reset, everything same like grow origin but grow hard is having the options for chess, like when we click on chess we will be having some events, first it will ask how do we want to play , either "Play Online" or "play offline", and for offline it has  options "play with bot" and "1 System 2 players" . here "1 system two player" will just remove all the events of options and just will make you allow to play in one board on one device .instead of "1 system 2 players" if you click on "Play with bot" nothing will happen because for playing with bot we have a folder called "Play BOT" (which is not actually working), which we have created so, that user can play with a computer brain or like Bot...But we have tried to integrate or connect with "STOCKFISH" which is a famous tool used as chess bot. and When it comes to "Play Online" we have availabled..two options that is Play "With Friend" and "Random Player", (both options currently do nothinng) we have created a folder called "chess" where we have successfully done, with connecting two players using web sockets, it just ask the us a username inorder to display who is playing..(we can enter any thing, like with what name we want to play).,and then it has options to "start" or "join" where on clicking start it will take you to board and in the upper portion it will provide you a "ROOM ID", by sharing it or entering in the system another player an join" but this is done upto same device, like it is working or works on same device localhost web socket connection, not globally works...so, here "Grow_origin", "Grow_hard" , "Play Bot", "chess" are different folders, where we next have to multiplayer in the "chess" folder if it works THEN include it to the "Grow_Hard", like wise in future if "Play Bot", successfully works connecting with a bot then do the same , include it to the "Grow_Hard".(IN future)
